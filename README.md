# ThinkPad Kidz Club 

Random resources and activities for a kids computer club. Maybe meeting infrequently, working independently alone or with parents etc. Focused on developing general literacy, confidence and practical skills through programming websites, video games, databases, small AI tools and building computers / computer parts from scratch in a variety of fun and practical materials.

 ## Thinkpad Yoga (11e) 8GB of RAM
This one is important. Great cheap small starter laptop—folds into a tablet with touchscreen. Used ones usually cost ~$100 so it’s okay if they get beat up / brokoen. Not super powerful with video streaming so less of a distraction box. Solid for early web dev, Python, maybe need to test for Lego robots and database stuff. Used / refurbished / new all fine. Should come with Windows installed. **Make sure it has 8GB of RAM! ⚠️**

## Lego Spike Robotics (Prime)
This can get picked up later after going through the Scratch, Python, HTML / CSS / JavaScript basics linked below. They're a little pricey but 100% worth the money. Lego provides tons of projects and tutorials that take kids from visual block coding through to python. The Prime kit is the only one you can code with python on. **Make sure to get the Prime kit! ⚠️**

## Learn Scratch!
Scratch is (basically) a programming language and set of tutorials and projects created by MIT to teach kids coding fundamentals. It's visual block coding and focuses on coding animated characters and games. It's extremely beginner friendly, kid friendly and fun.

## Learn Python!
Python is maybe the most popular, most powerful and beginner-friendly programming language that has ever existed. It is used literally everywhere from k-12 classrooms to research labs and machine learning training. These are some fun tutorials to start with but the sky is the limit with Python.

## Learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript!
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the languages of the internet. They aren't always pretty but they are easy to pick up, JavaScript is the only real programming language among them, and it has a strong reputation for being beginner friendly and flexible. Once we have the basics down for these we can start building real websites!

## Build a Website!
This is a big jump forward. Once you have a little HTML, CSS and JavaScript down you are ready to start building real websites and publishing them so they are live on the internet to share. To get started you'll want to make sure you have made **a GitHub account** to save and share your code through, and you'll want to make sure you've downloaded **Visual Studio Code** as a code editor.

## "Think" Merch from IBM 
This is just for fun. ThinkPads started as physical paper notebooks
that IBM gave to it’s engineers in the 1920s (?!). Eventually they used the
name for their ThinkPad laptops which would become one of the most
beloved and respected computer lines of all time. Anyway it’s crazy they still make
“think” merch, and it’s all pretty cheap and shipping is free (?).

## Build a Basic Computer Kit 

This is an amazing project probably for later on. Basically this is a kit that walks you through building a version of the first personal computer from scratch. It has a full series of youtube tutorial videos so it can be done independently or as a group in several sessions where we could watch the videos together and make sure everybody's computer stays on track.

## Build a (More) Basic Computer Kit 

This is more involved than the previous kit but walks you through making an even more basic computer from even more basic parts. It also has a full series of youtube tutorial videos so it can be done independently or as a group in several sessions where we could watch the videos together and work through the steps.

## ThinkPad T470

This one's probably for middle / high school. More serious laptop good for long-term use. Still cheap enough not to stress over damage and fully repairable with more power for advanced projects. Downsides, heavier, no touchscreen, pricier, and streams video better so more tempting distracting maybe. Again used / refurbished / new all good on Amazon and NewEgg.

## Mac Mini

This one's also probably for later. Not portable but huge power for the price. Macs are great / reliable but cost more and discourage hardware tinkering. M2, M3, M4 or better should be good for more advanced web dev, mobile apps, video games and AI. Again used, refurbished or new new all fine. Check Amazon or NewEgg.
