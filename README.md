# ThinkPad Club ðŸ¤–âœ¨

Random resources and activities for a kids computer club. Maybe meeting infrequently, working independently alone or with parents etc. Focused on developing general literacy, confidence and practical skills through programming websites, video games, databases, small AI tools and building computers / computer parts from scratch in a variety of fun and practical materials.

# Important Stuff to Get...

These seem like the core for starting up with programming in Python and learning how to build basic websites. The lego robotics kit is designed for classroom use and comes with a lot of lessons / projects that we can go through independently or as a group. The laptop (or any windows machine) is needed to program the Lego projects and can also be used to start building basic websites. Further down there are a lot of other things we can get later for other fun projects but these are the basics.

 ## Thinkpad Yoga (11e)

This one is important. Great cheap small starter laptopâ€”folds into a tablet with touchscreen. Used ones usually cost ~$100 so itâ€™s okay if they get beat up / brokoen. Not super powerful with video streaming so less of a distraction box. Solid for early web dev, Python, maybe need to test for Lego robots and database stuff. Used / refurbished / new all fine. Should come with Windows installed.

## Lego Spike Robotics (Prime)

These are a little pricey but 100% worth the money. They all come with dozens of free projects that you can do through an app that you should be able to run on any Windows machine including a ThinkPad that will incrementally teach coding starting with visual code blocks and building up to real-world python code. I **strongly reccomend starting with the Prime kit** since it's the only one you can code with python on.

# Other Stuff for Later Maybe...

All this stuff is less critical. Some of it's for more advanced projects, some of it's just for fun. All of it is awesome though and can / should get picked up if it seems inspiring. For the most part all the connected projects can be done independently or as a group so it's all money well spent if you go for any of it.

## Build a Basic Computer Kit 

This is an amazing project probably for later on. Basically this is a kit that walks you through building a version of the first personal computer from scratch. It has a full series of youtube tutorial videos so it can be done independently or as a group in several sessions where we could watch the videos together and make sure everybody's computer stays on track.

## Build a (More) Basic Computer Kit 

This is more involved than the previous kit but walks you through making an even more basic computer from even more basic parts. It also has a full series of youtube tutorial videos so it can be done independently or as a group in several sessions where we could watch the videos together and work through the steps.

## ThinkPad T470

This one's probably for middle / high school. More serious laptop good for long-term use. Still cheap enough not to stress over damage and fully repairable with more power for advanced projects. Downsides, heavier, no touchscreen, pricier, and streams video better so more tempting distracting maybe. Again used / refurbished / new all good on Amazon and NewEgg.

## Paper ThinkPad Notebooks 

This one's just for fun. ThinkPads started as paper notebooks for IBM engineers in the 50's. They also would put little plastic signs on all their giant ancient computers with the text "think" as far back as the 1920's. Somehow they still make and sell the notepads and other "think" merch.

## Mac Mini

This one's also probably for later. Not portable but huge power for the price. Macs are great / reliable but cost more and discourage hardware tinkering. M2, M3, M4 or better should be good for more advanced web dev, mobile apps, video games and AI. Again used, refurbished or new new all fine. Check Amazon or NewEgg.
