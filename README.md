# ThinkPad Club üìù ‚ú®

Random resources and activities for a kids computer club. Maybe meeting infrequently, working independently alone or with parents etc. Focused on developing general literacy, confidence and practical skills through programming websites, video games, databases, small AI tools and building computers / computer parts from scratch in a variety of fun and practical materials.

# Things to Buy...

Don't need to buy everything here, just a general list of things to facilitate different projects. None of these are a waste of money so go nuts, or pick them up as needed for individual projects.

 ## Thinkpad 11e

This is a perfect cheap / small starter laptop with an optional touchscreen. It's foldable so it can turn into a tablet basically. You can usually find a used one for around $100 so they can go nuts and beat them up / break them accidentally without it being a huge deal. Added benefit is that these aren't super powerful so they don't run high quality videos on youtube etc super well all the time, makes them less likely to turn into distraction machines. Can definitely accomodate any early web development or python projects. Should be able to handle projects with lego robots and databases but need to test.

Again used / refurbished is fine, new is fine. Should come with Windows pre-installed. Amazon and NewEgg are good places to get them. Look for something in the $100-$200 range.

## ThinkPad T470

This is a more serious laptop that they could keep and maintain through highschool, adulthood etc. But also it's still relatively cheap and no bid deal if they break it. All it's parts are swappable / repairable and it's going to be more powerful across the board for more advanced projects. Downsides are it is too heavy for kids to lug around freely, it does not have a touchscreen, it's more expensive and it is going to be able to stream video etc easily enough that it could turn into a youtube distraction machine a little more easily. Probably better to get them later but it was Danny's first real computer so it's here. He primarily uses the smaller thinkpad now though.

Once again used / refurbished is fine, new is fine. Should come with Windows pre-installed. Amazon and NewEgg are good places to get them.

## Paper ThinkPad Notebooks 

ThinkPads were originally just paper notebooks that IBM gave to their engineers. Having an analogue place to think through ideas / problems etc is an important way to make sure all the parts of the brain are getting used... maybe. Anyway it's cool they still make these. These should be baught as a group probably since IBM is set up to sell in large quantities for entire companies. It may or may not be possible to even get them in single digit quantities.

There are a few options on the notebooks, these are the two basic ones but they have cooler designy ones too.

## Other ThinkPad Merch

Obviously none of this is necessary. It's just cool that IBM still makes any of this. The original ThinkPad they made was just a paper notebook they'd give to their engineers that said "THINK" on it. Then it became possibly the most respected / beloved line of computer's in history amongst the hard-core technical geek crowd. Also it's just weird / awesome that IBM makes merch at all. May or may not be possible to buy any of this in small quantities since it's all aimed at companies.

## Mac Mini

These are not portable, but you get an extreme amount of power for how much they cost. Macs are great but obviously more expensive, and they don't promote as much hardware literacy because they do not encourage or really allow any swapping of parts etc. The big advantage is that any model from 2023 on will be powerful enough to handle advanced website building and most importantly AI projects. This is definitely something to get later after reaching the limits of a ThinkPad.

Look for an M2, M3, M4 or higher. Once again used / refurbished is fine, new is fine. Should come with Windows pre-installed. Amazon and NewEgg are good places to get them.
