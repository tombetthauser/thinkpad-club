# ThinkPad Club üìù ‚ú®

Random resources and activities for a kids computer club. Maybe meeting infrequently, working independently alone or with parents etc. Focused on developing general literacy, confidence and practical skills through programming websites, video games, databases, small AI tools and building computers / computer parts from scratch in a variety of fun and practical materials.

# Things to Buy...

Don't need to buy everything here, just a general list of things to facilitate different projects. None of these are a waste of money so go nuts, or pick them up as needed for individual projects.

 ## Thinkpad 11e

Cheap, small starter laptop‚Äîfolds into a tablet, some have touchscreens. Used ones often ~$100, so it‚Äôs okay if they get beat up. Not super powerful‚Äîstruggles with high-quality YouTube, so less distracting. Fine for early web dev, Python, maybe Lego robots and databases (test first). Used/refurb/new all fine. Should come with Windows. Check Amazon or NewEgg, aim for $100‚Äì$200 range.

## ThinkPad T470

More serious laptop‚Äîgood long-term option through high school and beyond. Still cheap enough not to stress over damage, and fully repairable with more power for advanced projects. Downsides: heavier, no touchscreen, pricier, and streams video easily (so more tempting distractions). Probably better for later; Danny‚Äôs first real computer, though he mostly uses the smaller ThinkPad now. again used/refurb/new all fine. Should have Windows. Amazon and NewEgg are good places to look.

## Paper ThinkPad Notebooks 

This one's just for fun. ThinkPads started as paper notebooks for IBM engineers in the 50's. They also would put little plastic signs on all their giant ancient computers with the text "think" as far back as the 1920's. Somehow they still make and sell the notepads and other "think" merch.

## Mac Mini

These are not portable, but you get an extreme amount of power for how much they cost. Macs are great but obviously more expensive, and they don't promote as much hardware literacy because they do not encourage or really allow any swapping of parts etc. The big advantage is that any model from 2023 on will be powerful enough to handle advanced website building and most importantly AI projects. This is definitely something to get later after reaching the limits of a ThinkPad.

Look for an M2, M3, M4 or higher. Once again used / refurbished is fine, new is fine. Should come with Windows pre-installed. Amazon and NewEgg are good places to get them.
