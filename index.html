            Website for our kids' computer club. Links to resources that will (hopefully) help teach them coding, AI literacy etc along with links to stuff to consider buying for various projects. All optional, mix and match. All of this can be done independently in any order but we can plan to meet up whenever to start new projects together, fix problems, get unstuck, share what they've been working on, etc.

            <p>
                There are a lot of different kinds of ThinkPad. Really anything called a ThinkPad that has 8GB of RAM or more should be fine. This one's my favorite for Danny right now because it has a touch screen and it's small / portable for kids. Used or refurbished is fine, you can usually find something for around $100-$200. New is fine too if you can find a good deal. <strong>Make sure it has 8GB of RAM! ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong>

                Probably best for middle or high school. It‚Äôs a more powerful, durable laptop with a professional feel. Downsides: heavier, no touchscreen, pricier, and possibly more distracting for kids. But a great long-term investment.

                Scratch is a great first visual programming language and set of free tutorials and projects created by MIT to teach kids coding fundamentals. It‚Äôs visual block coding which means it looks basically like sticking visual legos together and it focuses on coding animated characters and games which are quick and unintimidating. It‚Äôs extremely beginner friendly, kid friendly and fun.

                These are definitely more expensive than the Thumby and they can take a while to ship, but it's a normal size and is less of a retro novelty. Maybe for when they're older but it's a fun way to expose them to some tougher languages since you would be working with Lua or C which an excellent language for them to get exposed to. There's also a great community of kids and adults making games for this and they can share and submit their games to the official Playdate store.

                Computers are just logic machines‚Äîand logic can be modeled with lots of things, even dominoes! You can build basic logic gate circuits that mimic how computers process information. If you're ambitious, some people even build full calculators out of dominoes! Just be careful... one mistake and it all topples early!

                Not portable, but extremely capable. Macs are reliable and well-built, though less ideal for hardware tinkering. Any recent M2, M3, or M4 version should be great for advanced dev, games, video editing, or even AI work.

                Linux is a free, open-source operating system that powers most of the internet. You can install it on any ThinkPad or Raspberry Pi. It‚Äôs a great way to learn about computers and software development. You can install it on your ThinkPad alongside Windows or as a standalone OS. There are many distributions (distros) to choose from, but Ubuntu is a good beginner-friendly option.

                If you need to re-install Windows on your ThinkPad, you can do it for free. Just make sure you have a USB drive with at least 8GB of space. You can download the Windows installer from Microsoft and follow the instructions to create a bootable USB drive. Then, just boot your ThinkPad from the USB drive and follow the prompts to install Windows.

            Keeping it simple for now but there are a ton of fun projects that I'll add later including having them build some simple video games that they can actually get onto an old physical game boy and building basic computers from scratch to see how they work. Super excited for this!
