            Website for our kids' computer club. Links to resources that will (hopefully) help teach them coding, AI literacy etc along with links to stuff to consider buying for various projects. All optional, mix and match. All of this can be done independently in any order but we can plan to meet up whenever to start new projects together, fix problems, get unstuck, share what they've been working on, etc.

            <p>
                There are a lot of different kinds of ThinkPad. Really anything called a ThinkPad that has 8GB of RAM or more should be fine. This one's my favorite for Danny right now because it has a touch screen and it's small / portable for kids. Used or refurbished is fine, you can usually find something for around $100-$200. New is fine too if you can find a good deal. <strong>Make sure it has 8GB of RAM! ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong>

                Scratch is a great first visual programming language and set of free tutorials and projects created by MIT to teach kids coding fundamentals. It‚Äôs visual block coding which means it looks basically like sticking visual legos together and it focuses on coding animated characters and games which are quick and unintimidating. It‚Äôs extremely beginner friendly, kid friendly and fun.

                These are definitely more expensive than the Thumby and they can take a while to ship, but it's a normal size and is less of a retro novelty. Maybe for when they're older but it's a fun way to expose them to some tougher languages since you would be working with Lua or C which an excellent language for them to get exposed to. There's also a great community of kids and adults making games for this and they can share and submit their games to the official Playdate store.

They can start using a really frindly free program called GB Studio to get started and make a full range of simple to super complex games, then eventually they can transition to learning assembly language to make more complex games and learn how computers work at a lower level while still keeping things relatively simple and fun.
