<p>Random resources and activities for a kids computer club. Maybe
meeting infrequently, working independently alone or with parents etc.
Focused on developing general literacy, confidence and practical skills

practical materials.</p>

    <h2>
        Thinkpad Yoga (11e) 8GB of RAM
    </h2>
    This one is important. Great cheap
small starter laptop—folds into a tablet with touchscreen. Used ones
usually cost ~$100 so it’s okay if they get beat up / brokoen. Not super
powerful with video streaming so less of a distraction box. Solid for
early web dev, Python, maybe need to test for Lego robots and database
stuff. Used / refurbished / new all fine. Should come with Windows
installed. <strong>Make sure it has 8GB of RAM! ⚠️</strong>

<h2 id="lego-spike-robotics-prime">Lego Spike Robotics (Prime)</h2>
<p>This can get picked up later after going through the Scratch, Python, HTML / CSS / JavaScript basics linked below. They're a little pricey but 100% worth the money. Lego provides tons of projects and tutorials that take kids from visual block coding through to python. The Prime kit is the only one you can code with python on. <strong>Make sure to get the Prime kit! ⚠️</strong>

<h2 id="learn-scratch">Learn Scratch!</h2>
<p>Scratch is (basically) a programming language and set of tutorials
and projects created by MIT to teach kids coding fundamentals. It’s
visual block coding and focuses on coding animated characters and games.
It’s extremely beginner friendly, kid friendly and fun.

<h2 id="learn-python">Learn Python!</h2>
<p>Python is maybe the most popular, most powerful and beginner-friendly
programming language that has ever existed. It is used literally
everywhere from k-12 classrooms to research labs and machine learning
training. These are some fun tutorials to start with but the sky is the
limit with Python.

<h2 id="learn-html-css-javascript">Learn HTML, CSS &amp;
JavaScript!</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the languages of the internet. They
aren’t always pretty but they are easy to pick up, JavaScript is the
only real programming language among them, and it has a strong
reputation for being beginner friendly and flexible. Once we have the
basics down for these we can start building real websites!

<h2 id="build-a-website">Build a Website!</h2>
<p>This is a big jump forward. Once you have a little HTML, CSS and
JavaScript down you are ready to start building real websites and
publishing them so they are live on the internet to share. To get
started you’ll want to make sure you have made <strong>a GitHub
account</strong> to save and share your code through, and you’ll want to
make sure you’ve downloaded <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> as a
code editor.

<h2 id="think-merch-from-ibm">“Think” Merch from IBM</h2>
<p>This is just for fun. ThinkPads started as physical paper notebooks
that IBM gave to it’s engineers in the 1920s (?!). Eventually they used the
name for their ThinkPad laptops which would become one of the most
beloved and respected computer lines of all time. Anyway it’s crazy they still make
“think” merch, and it’s all pretty cheap and shipping is free (?).
