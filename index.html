        <h1>ThinkPad Club</h1>
        <p>
            Links to things I've either bought or tried with Danny or have researched and am planning to buy or do with him in the near future. Focused mainly on teaching him coding and computer literacy but also focused on AI literacy, science, language etc. No particular order to any of these, meant to be bought / tried one at a time definitely not all at once. 
        </p>  
        <p> 
            All this stuff can be done independently but we can meet up any time in groups or for playdates to pick new projects, fix problems or get unstuck on current projects, share finished projects etc. I'm always down to help them get started on something new or help them if they're blocked. Definitely a work in progress. üôÉ

            <p>
                There are a lot of different kinds of ThinkPad. Really anything called a ThinkPad that has 8GB of RAM or more should be fine. This one's my favorite for Danny right now because it has a touch screen and it's small / portable for kids. Used or refurbished is fine, you can usually find something for around $100-$200. New is fine too if you can find a good deal. <strong>Make sure it has 8GB of RAM! ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong>

                Probably best for middle or high school. It‚Äôs a more powerful, durable laptop with a professional feel. Downsides: heavier, no touchscreen, pricier, and possibly more distracting for kids. But a great long-term investment.

                Scratch is a great first visual programming language and set of free tutorials and projects created by MIT to teach kids coding fundamentals. It‚Äôs visual block coding which means it looks basically like sticking visual legos together and it focuses on coding animated characters and games which are quick and unintimidating. It‚Äôs extremely beginner friendly, kid friendly and fun.

                These are definitely more expensive than the Thumby and they can take a while to ship, but it's a normal size and is less of a retro novelty. Maybe for when they're older but it's a fun way to expose them to some tougher languages since you would be working with Lua or C which an excellent language for them to get exposed to. There's also a great community of kids and adults making games for this and they can share and submit their games to the official Playdate store.

                Not portable, but extremely capable. Macs are reliable and well-built, though less ideal for hardware tinkering. Any recent M2, M3, or M4 version should be great for advanced dev, games, video editing, or even AI work.

        <details>
            <summary>This was technically Danny's first computer...</summary>
            <p>
                Like a Speak & Spell but more like an actual computer and with a lot of good math games. When Danny was super little we would just keep Computron out in it's mode where it just shows words and reads them out loud. Seemed like it might have helped him start reading early. Also it has what's called a membrane keyboard meaning you can get food or liquids on it to a reasonable extent without it breaking and keeping it easy to clean. Not quite as entertaining as an ipad but served us well until he was at least 3 or 4. Definitely not for older kids. Also I believe it takes C batteries which I've literally never had to replace somehow.

        <p>
            Keeping it simple for now but there are a ton of fun projects that I'll add later including having them build some simple video games that they can actually get onto an old physical game boy and building basic computers from scratch to see how they work. Super excited for this!
